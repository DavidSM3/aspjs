# Tag Library / Front-End Template Syntax

The front-end templating system is designed to accept standard HTML with the addition of simple tags to denote variables, constants, dynamic includes, etc.

##Tag format
 The parsing engine will accept tags in the format <tag:something option="something" /> (in the case of a self-closing tag) or <tag:if option=""></tag:if> (in the case of an open and close tag).
 The format of this is intended to comply with the syntax of XML/HTML but there are also shorthand forms for common tags.
 
###This ReadMe is Incomplete
 More details are to be added including new syntax and shorthand notation.
 
 [year] is short for [date({yyyy})] which produces the four-digit year part of the current system date.
